# TrashMan
This project is a group submission for [Hack the Burgh IV 2020](https://my.2020.hacktheburgh.com/).

TrashMan is a procedurally generated game so the player can walk through a whole world!  :deciduous_tree:  :construction_worker: <br><br>
During the game TrashMan has to pick up as many trash items as he can and put them into the correct bins. 
However, a robot designed by EvilCorp. Inc. is constantly dropping new trash items in the forest. :smiling_imp:
Can you beat EvilCorp. Inc. and rescue the world from overpolution? 

## Navigation :computer:
You navigate TrashMan with your **arrow keys**. Items can be picked up trash with the **space key** when it is in your proximity 
(either above, below or besides you). You can bin items with **Enter** when you are in the proximity of the correct bin. 
You can leave the current screen by walking through the exits on each side of the screen (areas unoccupied by bushes) <br>
**Note**: You cannot pick up items which are diagonally close to you. So for example, if an item is above and to the right you cannot pick it up.

## Procedural Generation
Like Minecraft TrashMan is procedurally generated which means that an endless world is generated when you first start the game. 
Every game will be different! When you walk through an exit the code will trigger the generation of a new maze, of course with a new EvilCrop. Inc. robot
for you to defeat.
